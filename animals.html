						Bears are certainly big and fluffy, but there’s a lot more than meets the eye!A polar bear’s coat is made up of two unique layers: The shorter coat provides 							insulation from weather, while the longer coat prevents water from reaching the short coat layer and skin.Each layer serves a unique purpose and allows bears to 							thrive in frigid conditions. Bears can walk a short distance on their hind legs. Bears typically stand on their hind legs to get a better view or scent of what’s 							in front of them.This ability is cruelly exploited in bear dancing, as bears are able to shuffle in a way that makes it seem like they are “dancing.”Perhaps one of 							the lesser-known facts about bears is that they are among the most intelligent land animals in North America. They have the largest and most complex brains 							compared to other land mammals their size, and they rely on this brain for a number of behaviors.

						The African Savanna (Bush) elephant is the world's largest land animal – with adult males, or bull elephants, standing up to 3m high and weighing up to 6,000kg on 							average. Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that’s well over half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years.And it’s not just 							the adults – even calves are huge! At birth, a baby elephant can weigh 120kg - that’s almost 19 stone.Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk. 							Their trunks are perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal.Elephants use their trunks to suck up water to drink – it can contain up to 8 litres of 							water. They also use their trunks as a snorkel when swimming.An elephant’s skin is 2.5cm thick in most places.  The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up 							to 10 times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down.They keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking regular dust and 							mud baths.Elephants communicate in a variety of ways - including sounds like trumpet calls (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and 							scent. They can also communicate through seismic signals - sounds that create vibrations in the ground - which they may detect through their bones.The elephant's 							temporal lobe (the area of the brain associated with memory) is larger and denser than that of people - hence the saying 'elephants never forget'.

						Once it’s been born, it only takes a giraffe about half an hour until it can stand up.It can also run after just 10 hours!They even sleep and give birth standing 							up!They have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal. Giraffes don’t need much sleep, only between 10 minutes and 2 hours!Giraffes very rarely fight 							and are very peaceful animals.Males sometimes hit their necks against each other but this very rarely results in injury.The tongue a giraffe has is HUGE!They can 							be up to 45cm long so that they can forage on trees other animals can’t reach!

						In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic    							lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.wild lions in the west and central Africa are more 							closely related to these Asiatic lions in India than to those found in southern and east Africa.On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females 							weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone). Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their 						prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon.Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a 							huge advantage over their prey. They hunt more during storms as the noise and wind make it harder for prey to see and hear them.When hunting, lionesses have 							specific roles. Some play the role of 'centre' and others the role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.

						The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication. Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to 							help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.Like domestic cats, giant panda bears have vertical slits for 							pupils.Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her 							paw, arm or head.Giant pandas are good swimmers and excellent tree climbers. At 5 months old, giant panda cubs learn how to climb - sometimes practising by 							climbing on their mum. Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.

						THERE ARE 5 SPECIES OF RHINO IN THE WORLDThese include two African rhino species - black and white rhinos. The remaining three are Asian rhino species, which 							include greater one–horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos.Sumatran rhinos are the smallest of all rhinos, but they can still weigh 600kg (that’s almost 95 stone). On 							the other hand, white rhinos are the largest of the rhino species, weighing up to 3,500 kg. That is more than 550 stones, or well over 3 tonnes, which is mighty 							impressive considering they mainly eat grass and leaves.Rhinos’ eyesight isn’t great – they’re unable to see a motionless person at a distance of 30m – they mainly 							rely on their strong sense of smell.Rhinos make an array of funny noises when they’re communicating. During confrontations, they growl and make 'trumpet calls'.  							Black rhinos snort when they’re angry, make sneeze-like calls as alarms, scream if they’re scared and ‘mmwonk' when relaxed.Rhinos also communicate through their 							poo and urine. When rhino poo in the same place as other rhinos – an area known as a latrine – they can smell the poo and urine of other individuals, and know 							who's in the area.Rhinos can often be seen rolling around in mud, giving themselves a protective 'mud coat’ to keep them cool, stop insects biting and get rid of 							any parasites.Asian rhinos are also excellent swimmers, crossing rivers with ease. But their African relatives are very poor swimmers and can drown in deep water – 							so they stick to wallowing in mud for a cool-down

						Tigers were around about 2 million years ago.Around 3,000 of the world's wild tigers are in IndiaTigers have soft toe pads which help them walk silently through 							their habitat. A tiger will typically travel 6-12 miles during a night’s hunting. During the day, a tiger’s stripes can act as camouflage, allowing it to blend in 							with its surroundings for stalking and ambushing its prey.Tigers primarily hunt deer, but as opportunistic predators, they can also eat wild boars, birds, fish, 							rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and even insects. A large deer can provide a tiger with one week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful.Tigers 							don't usually eat their prey at the kill site - but instead drag their prey into cover to feed. If a tiger leaves - say to get a drink - it will cover it's kill by 							raking leaves, dirt, grass and even rocks over the carcass.Tiger is national animal of india.

						One of the many arctic wolf facts for kids is that they can weigh up to 80 kg! Generally, the average weight of wolves is 40 kg; the more far away they go from the 							equator, the heavier they get. In north America, the largest wolf that was killed was 75 kg. they show no mercy and don’t wait for their prey to move. They attack 							in groups in a coordinated manner and have specific signals and ways of communicating.Wolves are true carnivores to their core. They mostly eat large or medium 						hoofed animals but they also eat lizards, insectivores, reptiles, snakes, birds, rodents, and foxes. The alpha male and female of the group feed first and then the 							other members of the pack follow. They have razor sharp teeth which makes tearing down animals and clawing through the meat a lot easier.Wolves get aggressive only 							when they’re on their hunting spree – some species are very kind and gentle too.Wolves can run for many miles over the course of a day averaging at 5 mph. But when 							it comes to short distances, they can run up to speeds of 35 mph.There’s a reason wolves devour their prey immediately without mercy when they find them in sight. 							It’s because sometimes they have to go without food for days. Wolves aren’t picky eaters and usually eat whatever they get in front of them. Sometimes when 							they don’t get prey, they resort to eating livestock to compensate.
